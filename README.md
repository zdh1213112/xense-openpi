## About OpenPI

openpi holds open-source models and packages for robotics, originally published by the [Physical Intelligence team](https://www.physicalintelligence.company/).

This repository contains three types of models:

- **[π₀ model](https://www.physicalintelligence.company/blog/pi0)**: A flow-based vision-language-action model (VLA)
- **[π₀-FAST model](https://www.physicalintelligence.company/research/fast)**: An autoregressive VLA based on the FAST action tokenizer
- **[π₀.₅ model](https://www.physicalintelligence.company/blog/pi05)**: An upgraded version of π₀ with better open-world generalization trained with [knowledge insulation](https://www.physicalintelligence.company/research/knowledge_insulation)

For all models, we provide _base model_ checkpoints, pre-trained on 10k+ hours of robot data, and examples for using them out of the box or fine-tuning them to your own datasets.

## Requirements

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: This project requires NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support. CPU-only execution is not supported.**

### Hardware Requirements

**GPU:** NVIDIA GPU with CUDA 12 support and **minimum 24GB VRAM** is required for training and inference. The models use JAX with CUDA 12 and PyTorch with CUDA 12.8.

| Mode               | Minimum VRAM | Recommended GPU    |
| ------------------ | ------------ | ------------------ |
| Inference          | 24 GB        | RTX 4090 (24GB)    |
| Fine-Tuning (LoRA) | 24 GB        | RTX 4090 (24GB)    |
| Fine-Tuning (Full) | 70+ GB       | A100 (80GB) / H100 |

**Note:** These estimations assume a single GPU. You can use multiple GPUs with model parallelism (FSDP) to reduce per-GPU memory requirements by configuring `fsdp_devices` in the training config. Multi-node training is not currently supported.

**Operating System:** Ubuntu 22.04 or later (other Linux distributions may work but are not officially tested). Windows and macOS are not supported.

## Installation

We use the `lerobot-xense` mamba environment as the base, then install the client package followed by the main openpi package.

```bash
# Clone with submodules
git clone git@github.com:Vertax42/openpi.git

# Activate the base environment
mamba activate lerobot-xense

# 1. Install the client package (xense-client, used by robot runtimes)
cd packages/xense-client
GIT_LFS_SKIP_SMUDGE=1 pip install -e .

# 2. Install the main openpi package
cd ../..
GIT_LFS_SKIP_SMUDGE=1 pip install -e .
```

## Model Checkpoints

### Base Models

We provide multiple base VLA model checkpoints. These checkpoints have been pre-trained on 10k+ hours of robot data, and can be used for fine-tuning.

| Model        | Use Case    | Description                                                                                                 | Checkpoint Path                                |

| $\pi_0$-FAST | Fine-Tuning | Base autoregressive [π₀-FAST model](https://www.physicalintelligence.company/research/fast) for fine-tuning | `gs://openpi-assets/checkpoints/pi0_fast_base` |
| $\pi_{0.5}$  | Fine-Tuning | Base [π₀.₅ model](https://www.physicalintelligence.company/blog/pi05) for fine-tuning                       | `gs://openpi-assets/checkpoints/pi05_base`     |

### Fine-Tuned Models

We also provide "expert" checkpoints for various robot platforms and tasks. These models are fine-tuned from the base models above and intended to run directly on the target robot. These may or may not work on your particular robot. Since these checkpoints were fine-tuned on relatively small datasets collected with the DROID Franka setup, they might not generalize to your particular setup, though we found the DROID checkpoint to generalize quite broadly in practice.

| Model              | Use Case                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Checkpoint Path                                 |
| ------------------ | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| $\pi_0$-FAST-DROID | Inference               | $\pi_0$-FAST model fine-tuned on the [DROID dataset](https://droid-dataset.github.io/): can perform a wide range of simple table-top manipulation tasks 0-shot in new scenes on the DROID robot platform                              | `gs://openpi-assets/checkpoints/pi0_fast_droid` |
| $\pi_0$-DROID      | Fine-Tuning             | $\pi_0$ model fine-tuned on the [DROID dataset](https://droid-dataset.github.io/): faster inference than $\pi_0$-FAST-DROID, but may not follow language commands as well                                                             | `gs://openpi-assets/checkpoints/pi0_droid`      |

By default, checkpoints are automatically downloaded from `gs://openpi-assets` and are cached in `~/.cache/openpi` when needed. You can overwrite the download path by setting the `OPENPI_DATA_HOME` environment variable.

## Running Inference for a Pre-Trained Model

Our pre-trained model checkpoints can be run with a few lines of code (here our $\pi_0$-FAST-DROID model):

```python
from openpi.training import config as _config
from openpi.policies import policy_config
from openpi.shared import download

config = _config.get_config("pi05_droid")
checkpoint_dir = download.maybe_download("gs://openpi-assets/checkpoints/pi05_droid")

# Create a trained policy.
policy = policy_config.create_trained_policy(config, checkpoint_dir)

# Run inference on a dummy example.
example = {
    "observation/exterior_image_1_left": ...,
    "observation/wrist_image_left": ...,
    ...
    "prompt": "pick up the fork"
}
action_chunk = policy.infer(example)["actions"]
```

You can also test this out in the [example notebook](examples/inference.ipynb).

We provide detailed step-by-step examples for running inference of our pre-trained checkpoints on [DROID](examples/droid/README.md) and [ALOHA](examples/aloha_real/README.md) robots.

**Remote Inference**: The client package (`xense-client`) provides a websocket-based policy client so that model inference can run on a more powerful remote GPU server while the robot runtime streams observations and receives action chunks in real time. See `examples/simple_client/` for a minimal reference implementation.

**Test inference without a robot**: We provide a [script](examples/simple_client/README.md) for testing inference without a robot. This script will generate a random observation and run inference with the model. See [here](examples/simple_client/README.md) for more details.

## Fine-Tuning Base Models on Your Own Data

We will explain how to fine-tune a base model on your own data using examples from the DROID dataset and Xense platform. We will explain three steps:

1. Convert your data to a LeRobot dataset (which we use for training)
2. Defining training configs and running training
3. Spinning up a policy server and running inference

### 1. Convert your data to a LeRobot dataset

For training, we use the LeRobot dataset format. You can convert your own data to this format by following the LeRobot documentation. We provide example conversion scripts for the DROID dataset in the [`examples/droid`](examples/droid) directory.

### 2. Defining training configs and running training

A training config can be defined in **two ways**, both resolved by name through `get_config(name)`:

1. **YAML (preferred for new tasks)** — one file per task in `configs/`. Per-user
   configs in `configs/<name>.yaml` are gitignored; shared templates live in
   `configs/_examples/<name>.yaml`. See [`configs/README.md`](configs/README.md) for
   the schema and [`docs/yaml_config_changelog.md`](docs/yaml_config_changelog.md)
   for design notes.
2. **Python `_CONFIGS` list in [`config.py`](src/openpi/training/config.py)** —
   used by legacy entries that can't round-trip through YAML (`pi0_droid`, LoRA
   configs with `flax.nnx` freeze filters, etc.). New tasks should prefer YAML to
   avoid merge conflicts in this central file.

Lookup order: `configs/<name>.yaml` → `configs/_examples/<name>.yaml` → `_CONFIGS_DICT[name]`. First match wins.

Shared building blocks (used by both modes):

- Data transforms: Define the data mapping from your environment to the model (see [`droid_policy.py`](src/openpi/policies/droid_policy.py) or [`xense_flare_policy.py`](src/openpi/policies/xense_flare_policy.py) for examples)
- `DataConfig`: Defines how to process raw data from LeRobot dataset for training
- `TrainConfig`: Defines fine-tuning hyperparameters, data config, and weight loader

#### Defining a new training config in YAML

Copy the closest example from `configs/_examples/` and edit it. For a personal
in-flight experiment, put the new file directly under `configs/` (it will be
gitignored). For something you want to share with the team, put it under
`configs/_examples/` and open a PR.

**Reference:** [`configs/_examples/_FULL_REFERENCE.yaml`](configs/_examples/_FULL_REFERENCE.yaml)
lists every `TrainConfig` field, every registered class for each polymorphic
slot (`model.type`, `data.type`, `weight_loader.type`, etc.), and the current
default for each value. Open it alongside your real config when you need to
look up "what does field X do" or "what else can I put in `data.type`".

**LoRA fine-tuning:** set `model.paligemma_variant` and/or
`model.action_expert_variant` to a `*_lora` value (e.g. `gemma_2b_lora`,
`gemma_300m_lora`). The YAML loader detects the `lora` substring and
auto-derives the correct `freeze_filter` from
`Pi0Config.get_freeze_filter()` — you don't need to (and can't) write a
flax filter tree in YAML. See
[`pi05_base_bi_flexiv_pack_6_cosmetic_bottles_lora.yaml`](configs/_examples/pi05_base_bi_flexiv_pack_6_cosmetic_bottles_lora.yaml)
for a complete LoRA example.

```yaml
# configs/my_task.yaml  (filename stem = config name; do not put `name:` inside)

model:
  type: Pi0Config              # registered in src/openpi/training/registry.py
  pi05: true
  paligemma_variant: gemma_2b
  action_expert_variant: gemma_300m
  enable_training_time_rtc: true
  max_delay: 10

data:
  type: LeRobotBiFlexivDataConfig
  repo_id: Xense/<your_dataset>
  use_delta_cartesian_actions: true
  default_prompt: "Describe the task here."
  base_config:
    prompt_from_task: true

weight_loader:
  type: CheckpointWeightLoader
  params_path: gs://openpi-assets/checkpoints/pi05_base/params

batch_size: 256
num_train_steps: 40000
num_workers: 64
fsdp_devices: 8
```

Then use it exactly like any other config:

```bash
python scripts/compute_norm_stats.py --config-name my_task
XLA_PYTHON_CLIENT_MEM_FRACTION=0.9 python scripts/train.py my_task --exp-name=run_0520 --overwrite
python scripts/serve_policy.py policy:checkpoint --policy.config=my_task --policy.dir=checkpoints/my_task/run_0520/<step>
```

⚠️ Before committing a YAML into `configs/_examples/`, scrub any machine-local
absolute paths from `weight_loader.params_path` (e.g. `/home/<you>/...`). Use
upstream URLs (`gs://openpi-assets/...`) or paths that every contributor can
resolve.

python scripts/migrate_configs_to_yaml.py --overwrite
pytest src/openpi/training/yaml_examples_equivalence_test.py
```

#### Running training

Before we can run training, we need to compute the normalization statistics for the training data. Run the script below with the name of your training config (e.g., for Xense):

```bash
python scripts/compute_norm_stats.py --config-name pi05_base_arx5_lora
```

Now we can kick off training with the following command (the `--overwrite` flag is used to overwrite existing checkpoints if you rerun fine-tuning with the same config):

```bash
XLA_PYTHON_CLIENT_MEM_FRACTION=0.9 python scripts/train.py pi05_base_arx5_lora --exp-name=my_experiment --overwrite
```

The command will log training progress to the console and save checkpoints to the `checkpoints` directory. You can also monitor training progress on the Weights & Biases dashboard. For maximally using the GPU memory, set `XLA_PYTHON_CLIENT_MEM_FRACTION=0.9` before running training -- this enables JAX to use up to 90% of the GPU memory (vs. the default of 75%).

**Note:** We provide functionality for _reloading_ normalization statistics for state / action normalization from pre-training. This can be beneficial if you are fine-tuning to a new task on a robot that was part of our pre-training mixture.

### 3. Spinning up a policy server and running inference

Once training is complete, we can run inference by spinning up a policy server and then querying it from your robot runtime. Launching a model server is easy (we use the checkpoint for iteration 20,000 for this example, modify as needed):

```bash
python scripts/serve_policy.py policy:checkpoint --policy.config=pi05_base_arx5_lora --policy.dir=checkpoints/pi05_base_arx5_lora/my_experiment/19999
```

This will spin up a server that listens on port 8000 and waits for observations to be sent to it. We can then run an evaluation script (or robot runtime) that queries the server.

For more detailed examples of running inference on specific platforms, see:

- [DROID README](examples/droid/README.md) for DROID platform
- [BiARX5 README](examples/bi_arx5_real/README.md) for Xense platform

If you want to embed a policy server call in your own robot runtime, take a look at the `xense-client` package at `packages/xense-client/` and the minimal reference in `examples/simple_client/`.

### More Examples

We provide more examples for how to fine-tune and run inference with our models on the ALOHA platform in the following READMEs:

## PyTorch Support

openpi now provides PyTorch implementations of π₀ and π₀.₅ models alongside the original JAX versions! The PyTorch implementation has been validated on the DROID benchmark (both inference and finetuning). A few features are currently not supported (this may change in the future):

- The π₀-FAST model
- Mixed precision training
- FSDP (fully-sharded data parallelism) training
- LoRA (low-rank adaptation) training
- EMA (exponential moving average) weights during training

### Setup

1. Make sure transformers 4.53.2 is installed: `pip show transformers`

2. Apply the transformers library patches (adjust the site-packages path for your Python version):
   ```bash
   # Find your site-packages path
   python -c "import transformers; print(transformers.__file__)"
   # Copy patches
   cp -r ./src/openpi/models_pytorch/transformers_replace/* $(python -c "import transformers, os; print(os.path.dirname(transformers.__file__))")/
   ```

This overwrites several files in the transformers library with necessary model changes: 1) supporting AdaRMS, 2) correctly controlling the precision of activations, and 3) allowing the KV cache to be used without being updated.

### Converting JAX Models to PyTorch

To convert a JAX model checkpoint to PyTorch format:

```bash
python examples/convert_jax_model_to_pytorch.py \
    --checkpoint_dir /path/to/jax/checkpoint \
    --config_name <config name> \
    --output_path /path/to/converted/pytorch/checkpoint
```

### Running Inference with PyTorch

The PyTorch implementation uses the same API as the JAX version - you only need to change the checkpoint path to point to the converted PyTorch model:

```python
from openpi.training import config as _config
from openpi.policies import policy_config
from openpi.shared import download

config = _config.get_config("pi05_droid")
checkpoint_dir = "/path/to/converted/pytorch/checkpoint"

# Create a trained policy (automatically detects PyTorch format)
policy = policy_config.create_trained_policy(config, checkpoint_dir)

# Run inference (same API as JAX)
action_chunk = policy.infer(example)["actions"]
```

### Policy Server with PyTorch

The policy server works identically with PyTorch models - just point to the converted checkpoint directory:

```bash
python scripts/serve_policy.py policy:checkpoint \
    --policy.config=pi05_droid \
    --policy.dir=/path/to/converted/pytorch/checkpoint
```

### Finetuning with PyTorch

To finetune a model in PyTorch:

1. Convert the JAX base model to PyTorch format:

   ```bash
   python examples/convert_jax_model_to_pytorch.py \
       --config_name <config name> \
       --checkpoint_dir /path/to/jax/base/model \
       --output_path /path/to/pytorch/base/model
   ```

2. Specify the converted PyTorch model path in your config using `pytorch_weight_path`

3. Launch training using one of these modes:

```bash
# Single GPU training:
python scripts/train_pytorch.py <config_name> --exp_name <run_name> --save_interval <interval>

# Example:
python scripts/train_pytorch.py debug --exp_name pytorch_test
python scripts/train_pytorch.py debug --exp_name pytorch_test --resume  # Resume from latest checkpoint

# Multi-GPU training (single node):
torchrun --standalone --nnodes=1 --nproc_per_node=<num_gpus> scripts/train_pytorch.py <config_name> --exp_name <run_name>

# Example using debug config:
torchrun --standalone --nnodes=1 --nproc_per_node=2 scripts/train_pytorch.py debug --exp_name pytorch_ddp_test
torchrun --standalone --nnodes=1 --nproc_per_node=2 scripts/train_pytorch.py debug --exp_name pytorch_ddp_test --resume

# Multi-Node Training:
torchrun \
    --nnodes=<num_nodes> \
    --nproc_per_node=<gpus_per_node> \
    --node_rank=<rank_of_node> \
    --master_addr=<master_ip> \
    --master_port=<port> \
    scripts/train_pytorch.py <config_name> --exp_name=<run_name> --save_interval <interval>
```

### Precision Settings

JAX and PyTorch implementations handle precision as follows:

**JAX:**

1. Inference: most weights and computations in bfloat16, with a few computations in float32 for stability
2. Training: defaults to mixed precision: weights and gradients in float32, (most) activations and computations in bfloat16. You can change to full float32 training by setting `dtype` to float32 in the config.

**PyTorch:**

1. Inference: matches JAX -- most weights and computations in bfloat16, with a few weights converted to float32 for stability
2. Training: supports either full bfloat16 (default) or full float32. You can change it by setting `pytorch_training_precision` in the config. bfloat16 uses less memory but exhibits higher losses compared to float32. Mixed precision is not yet supported.

With torch.compile, inference speed is comparable between JAX and PyTorch.

| CUDA/GPU errors                        | Verify NVIDIA drivers are installed correctly. For Docker, ensure nvidia-container-toolkit is installed. Check GPU compatibility. You do NOT need CUDA libraries installed at a system level --- they will be installed via pip as part of openpi's dependencies. You may even want to try _uninstalling_ system CUDA libraries if you run into CUDA issues, since system libraries can sometimes cause conflicts.                                                                                                  |
| Import errors when running examples    | Make sure you've installed all dependencies with `pip install -e .`. Some examples may have additional requirements listed in their READMEs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Action dimensions mismatch             | Verify your data processing transforms match the expected input/output dimensions of your robot. Check the action space definitions in your policy classes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Diverging training loss                | Check the `q01`, `q99`, and `std` values in `norm_stats.json` for your dataset. Certain dimensions that are rarely used can end up with very small `q01`, `q99`, or `std` values, leading to huge states and actions after normalization. You can manually adjust the norm stats as a workaround.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
